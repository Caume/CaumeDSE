2012-06-18 0.90.alpha

	* Implemented resource handling for individual columns in documents
	of type file.csv, via the contentColumn resource (see README for
	details).  You can now append new columns or create csv documents
	with their first column(POST), read individual columns (GET), delete
	individual columns or the whole document if there are no other
	columns (DELETE) and confirm that individual columns exist (HEAD).

	* With column and row resources we now provide a basic NoSQL
	approach to hanling data tables (file.csv documents) easily.

	* Implemented several controls for row and column handling. In
	particular SQL injection controls.

	* fixes and code clean up

2012-05-22 0.90.alpha

	* Implemented resource handling for individual rows in documents of
	type file.csv, via the contentRow resource (see README for details). 
	You can now append new rows (POST), read individual rows (GET),
	delete individual rows (DELETE), confirm that individual rows exist
	(HEAD) or update some column values of a specific row (PUT).

	* Some fixes and code clean up

2012-05-08 0.90.alpha

	* Implemented HMAC for MACs using a key derived from PBKDF (v2 is
	the default with 2000 rounds and sha256) and the same salt that is
	being used for encrypting/decrypting files or register elements.

	* Implemented Encrypt-Then-MAC on all registers in secure internal
	databases (with verification before decrypting).

	* Implemented Encrypt-Then-MAC for protected databases (e.g.
	imported CSV files) and for RAW files; it is applied to the whole
	binary file. MAC is also verified before decrypting the file.

	* Some bug fixes.
	
	* Updated version to 0.90.alpha
