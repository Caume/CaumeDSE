2012-05-08 0.90.alpha

	* Implemented HMAC for MACs using a key derived from PBKDF (v2 is
	the default with 2000 rounds and sha256) and the same salt that is
	being used for encrypting/decrypting files or register elements.

	* Implemented Encrypt-Then-MAC on all registers in secure internal
	databases (with verification before decrypting).

	* Implemented Encrypt-Then-MAC for protected databases (e.g.
	imported CSV files) and for RAW files; it is applied to the whole
	binary file. MAC is also verified before decrypting the file.

	* Some bug fixes.
	
	* Updated version to 0.90.alpha
